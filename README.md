CUSTOM CRAIGSLIST RENTAL SEARCH ALERTS FOR THE BAY AREA

Considering how competitive the rental market in Bay Area currently is, it helps to be the first to know when a property becomes available.

Most rental homes in the Bay Area are advertised on craigslist.org. You may however miss some of these listings, because you're on the move or just forget to check for updates.

If you subscribe for alerts on this webpage, you will receive a phone call at the frequency you choose. You will hear a message in the call that tells you how many new listings have been posted. 

This is a J2EE web application that uses the Twilio API for the phone calls. It is currently running on an apache tomcat server.

It is available online at http://homesearch.cloudapp.net/homeFinder/HomeFinder.jsp
