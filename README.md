CUSTOM CRAIGSLIST RENTAL SEARCH ALERTS FOR THE BAY AREA

WHAT IS IT?
Considering how competitive the rental market in Bay Area currently is, it helps to be the first to know when a property becomes available.

Most rental homes in the Bay Area are advertised on craigslist.org. You may however miss some of these listings, because you're on the move or just forget to check for updates.

This site allows you to receive calls at regular intervals (that you pick) informing you of new listings on craigslist. We also allow you to set certain search criteria to reduce noise.

HOW DO I USE IT?
The website is available online at http://homesearch.cloudapp.net/homeFinder/HomeFinder.jsp

If you subscribe for alerts on this webpage, you will receive a phone call at the frequency you choose. "Call me now" is a way to test the application, if you don't want to wait for an entire hour or a day.
When you do receive a call, you will hear a message that tells you how many new listings have been posted, so you can view the details online. Craigslist forbids 3rd part applications from scraping their results, so this website will not provide the actual listings.

TECH STUFF
This is a J2EE web application that uses the Twilio API for the phone calls. It is currently running on an apache tomcat server.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
1) Option to receive an sms 
2) Keep track of the state for each subscriber
3) Visual enhancements
4) Opt out of the calls (#1 priority)
5) Validate input
